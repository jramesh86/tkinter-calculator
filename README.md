# Tkinter Calculator

A simple **Advanced Calculator** built with **Python** using the **Tkinter** GUI library.  
This calculator supports basic arithmetic, scientific functions, and constants. It has a **dark-themed interface** with color-coded buttons for easy usage.

## Features

### Basic Operations
- Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`)
- Decimal point (`.`)
- Clear (`C`) and Backspace (`BS`)
- Evaluate (`=`)

### Advanced Functions
- **Trigonometry:** `sin`, `cos`, `tan` (in degrees)
- **Roots and Powers:** square root (`√`), cube root (`∛`), square (`x²`), cube (`x³`)
- **Logarithms:** common log (`log`), natural log (`ln`)
- **Constants:** π (`π`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jramesh86/tkinter-calculator.git
Change directory to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd tkinter-calculator
Check Python version (Python 3.x is required):

bash
Copy code
python --version
Run the calculator:

bash
Copy code
python claculator.py
⚠️ Note: Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python 3, so you don’t need to install it separately.

How to Use
Enter numbers using the buttons.

Use operators (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.

Use scientific functions:

Example: Enter 30 → Click sin → Result: 0.5

Clear the display: Click C

Delete the last digit: Click BS

Calculate result: Click =

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Tkinter (GUI library)

Math module (for trigonometric and logarithmic functions)

Future Improvements
Add keyboard input support

Add memory functions: M+, M-, MR, MC

Enable parentheses and complex expressions

Theme customization (light/dark mode)

Quick Tips
Tkinter GUI opens in a separate window, not in the terminal.

If the window doesn’t appear, check that your Python version is 3.x.

You can move the window around, resize (if allowed), and use all buttons interactively.

If you want, I can also **write a one-liner “commands to run the calculator” section** at the top so a beginner can **just copy-paste commands and run it immediately**.  

Do you want me to do that?
